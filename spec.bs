Legal Considerations {#legal}
=============================

The [Trust Envelope model](#model) was developed to be regulation-agnostic,
to be able to tackle legal requirements from different jurisdictions,
different branches of law, e.g., data protection or intellectual property law, and 
different data types, e.g., personal or non-personal data.
This is of particular importance to understand and correctly model all the parties
that might have rights and obligations over the data unit,
how they interplay, and how they are to be correctly interpreted and enforced.

Nonetheless,
the terms chosen to model data provenance,
in particular related to the source entity of the data,
where kept in line with European legislation
such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [[!gdpr]]
and the Data Governance Act (DGA) [[!dga]]
as these regulations are being followed 
and similarly adapted in other jurisdictions' regulations.

Moreover,
by incorporating provenance and usage policies as fundamental components of trustful data exchanges,
Trust Envelopes can be used as auditing tools by external legal authorities to assess good and poor practices of recipients,
and possibly held as proof in judgments for the later case.
