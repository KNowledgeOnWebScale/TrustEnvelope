IntrodÂ­uction {#introduction}
============================

The physical world has finite number of carriers.
Let's not replicate that! the digital world doesn't have that constraint.
...

We introduce in the specification here Trust Envelopes, which is a unique carrier every time, which adds unique value every time.


<mark>TODO:</mark> elaborate and make clear the importance of Trust Envelopes as technological solution for trust

<mark>TODO:</mark> add navigation?

Requirements {#requirements}
============================

- **Explicitness from senders**: Senders must define clear usage control policies that specify how data may be processed, for what purpose, and under which conditions.
- **Specificity from recipients**: Recipients must be able to articulate exactly what data they require for what purpose. This is related to data minimization and ensures a high signal-to-noise ratio, reducing unnecessary exposure for the sender.
- **Uniqueness of each exchange**: Every transaction is context-dependent and shaped by highly specific policies.
- **Legal compliance**: Exchanges must adhere to jurisdictional regulations such as the [[!GDPR]] in Europe or the California Consumer Privacy Act ([[!CCPA]]).
- **Accountability**: Transparency in both data verification and usage is essential. All parties must be able to audit the lifecycle of the data and demonstrate compliance when required.

Materialization {#materialization}
==================================

## Purchase of age-restricted goods ## {#age-verification}
Alice wants to have alcoholic beverages delivered to her house in Belgium, 
where the legal age to buy alcoholic beverages is 18. 
She goes online to Alcoholic Beverages Corporations (ABC) and attempts to buy beer. 
The store requires sufficient evidence to demonstrate that each purchase complies to Belgian law. 
Therefore, ABC restricts purchases for alcoholic beverages to those who provide sufficient evidence, which is being over the age of 18. 
There are multiple carriers of that evidence: a national ID card, an international passport, a driver's license, ... . (note that the three provided are all government issued documents) 

As such, she sends a [Trust Envelope](#trustenvelope-1) to ABC. 
It is a technological solution that carries this evidence in a uniquely crafted envelope, tailored specifically for the transaction between Alice and ABC.<br>
The **data unit** contains a proof ([represented by a VP](#data-unit-1)), issued by the government, that Alice is over 18 years old. 
The envelope also encloses an [**ODRL policy**](#policy-1) permitting ABC to use the data unit solely for age verification purposes.

For this envelope, there are three [signatures](#signatures-1) made by Alice.<br>
First, the provenance signature (`ex:signedDataProvenance1`) and policy provenance (`ex:signedPolicyProvenance1`) are made.
For the provenance, this entails signing all triples related to the data (as shown by [`https://country.org/uuid1`](#data-unit-1)) AND all the triples of `ex:dataProvenance1` minus the `te:sign` triples (as this is the signature and can only be added after the signing).
The policy signature strategy is the same, the signature entails all triples related to the policy ([`ex:policy1`](#policy-1)) AND all the triples of `ex:policyProvenance1` minus the `te:sign` triples.<br>
Finally, a signature is made over the whole Trust Envelope, selecting all triples related to the Trust Envelope apart from `te:sign` triples.

Note: Right now, this selection principle leaves room for interpretation given the Open World assumption of RDF. 
In current example, it is relatively clear which triples are meant, as all of them are explicitly shown.
To create software, however, it is important to be explicit in the selecting of those triples. One potential solution for this purpose is using [RDF context associations](https://knowledgeonwebscale.github.io/rdf-context-associations/).

Note: A choice in this example is made to have an **ODRL Agreement** as policy.
In practice, this implies that both the sender/assigner (Alice) and the recipient/assignee (ABC) have, in some form, signed the policy.
As a result, itâs not a one-sided declaration but rather a mutual contract. Both parties acknowledge and are expected to honor the policy.

## Cargo Monitoring ## {#cargo-monitoring}

In logistics, real-time cargo tracking is essential for optimizing planning and estimating time of arrival.
In this use case, we have Beverage Company (BC) that contracts Boxport to transport goods via inland waterways. 
At all times BC wants the location of the cargo in real-time to estimate the delivery time.
Waterway authorities monitor vessel movements and can verify location data.
This includes of course Bluewave, the vessel employed by Boxport to transport BC its cargo.

To monitor its fleet, Boxport requests access to this data.
The authority responds by issuing a Trust Envelope that encapsulates Bluewave's precise location at time *t*
and explicitly grants Boxport permission to use and distribute the data.

When BC requests the location of its cargo from Boxport,
the latter responds with a new Trust Envelope .
This envelope materializes the previously received 
Trust Envelope from the waterway authority into derived cargo spatio-temporal data, 
using it as the basis for a new, context-specific data unit.

<div class="example" highlight="turtle" id="trustenvelope-2">

Legal Considerations {#legal}
=============================

The [Trust Envelope model](#model) was developed to be regulation-agnostic,
to be able to tackle legal requirements from different jurisdictions,
different branches of law, e.g., data protection or intellectual property law, and 
different data types, e.g., personal or non-personal data.
This is of particular importance to understand and correctly model all the parties
that might have rights and obligations over the data unit,
how they interplay, and how they are to be correctly interpreted and enforced.

Nonetheless,
the terms chosen to model data provenance,
in particular related to the source entity of the data,
where kept in line with European legislation
such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [[!gdpr]]
and the Data Governance Act (DGA) [[!dga]]
as these regulations are being followed 
and similarly adapted in other jurisdictions' regulations.

Moreover,
by incorporating provenance and usage policies as fundamental components of trustful data exchanges,
Trust Envelopes can be used as auditing tools by external legal authorities to assess good and poor practices of recipients,
and possibly held as proof in judgments for the later case.
